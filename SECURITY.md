# Security Implementation Status

This document tracks the security hardening measures implemented for the MyBodyScan Firebase project.

## âœ… Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Firestore Security Rules
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED & UNIFIED
- **File**: `firestore.rules` (unified from `database.rules.json`)
- **Features**:
  - Owner-only access patterns with helper functions for clarity
  - Blocked sensitive field updates (credits, billing, stripe data)
  - Server-only write access for scan results and credit operations
  - Strict validation for nutrition logs with reasonable bounds
  - Complete denial of client access to payments and stripe_events collections
  - Enhanced scan security: client can only update notes, not results

### 2. Payment Redirect Validation
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED  
- **File**: `src/lib/api.ts`
- **Features**:
  - URL validation for all Stripe checkout redirects
  - Allowlist-based hostname verification (checkout.stripe.com only)
  - Error handling for invalid URLs to prevent open redirects

### 3. Legacy Auth Component Cleanup
- **Status**: âœ… COMPLETED
- **Action**: Removed legacy auth components (`AuthContext.tsx.disabled`, `ProtectedRouteMBS.tsx.disabled`)
- **Rationale**: Eliminated potential confusion and ensured single source of truth for Firebase auth

### 4. App Check Configuration
- **Status**: âœ… DOCUMENTED
- **File**: `.env.example` 
- **Next Steps**: Set `VITE_APPCHECK_SITE_KEY` in production environment

## ðŸ”§ Cloud Functions Security (Existing)

The Cloud Functions in `functions/index.js` already implement:
- Authentication verification for all protected endpoints
- App Check token validation (soft verification)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Stripe webhook signature verification
- Rate limiting considerations

## ðŸ“‹ Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. **App Check Setup**:
   - [ ] Configure reCAPTCHA Enterprise in Firebase Console
   - [ ] Set `VITE_APPCHECK_SITE_KEY` environment variable
   - [ ] Enable App Check enforcement for Firestore and Functions

2. **Firestore Rules**:
   - [ ] Deploy the updated `firestore.rules` to production
   - [ ] Test rules with Firebase emulator suite

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - [ ] Verify all Firebase config variables are set
   - [ ] Confirm Functions base URL points to production

4. **Security Testing**:
   - [ ] Run `npm test` to verify Firestore rules
   - [ ] Test payment flows in staging environment
   - [ ] Verify App Check tokens are being sent

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices Maintained

- No API keys or secrets in client code
- All sensitive operations server-side only
- Input validation on both client and server
- Authentication required for all user data access
- Principle of least privilege for database access
