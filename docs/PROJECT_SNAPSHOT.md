# MyBodyScan Project Snapshot

**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025  
**Project:** MyBodyScan - AI-powered body composition analysis and fitness coaching app

## What the App Is

### Features
- **Body Scan Analysis**: AI-powered body composition analysis using photo/video capture
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Food logging with USDA/OpenFoodFacts integration, barcode scanning
- **AI Coach**: Personalized fitness coaching with chat interface and workout plans
- **Workout Management**: Custom workout programs, progress tracking, and completion logging
- **Health Dashboard**: Daily overview with calories, meals, workouts, and scan history
- **Credit System**: Pay-per-scan model with credit management and refunds
- **Demo Mode**: Full app experience without authentication for testing

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **Backend**: Firebase Functions (Node.js 20) + Express
- **Database**: Firestore (NoSQL)
- **Storage**: Firebase Cloud Storage
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (Google, Apple, Email)
- **Payments**: Stripe integration
- **AI Services**: OpenAI GPT-4 for coaching and vision analysis
- **Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Vitest (Unit/Integration)
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting + Functions

## What Works Now

### ‚úÖ Core Features
- **Authentication**: Google/Apple/Email sign-in with proper security headers
- **Body Scanning**: Complete scan workflow with photo/video capture, AI processing, and results
- **Nutrition**: Food search, barcode scanning, meal logging with USDA/OpenFoodFacts fallback
- **AI Coach**: Chat interface with OpenAI integration, workout plan generation
- **Workouts**: Program catalog, progress tracking, workout adjustments
- **Health Dashboard**: Daily overview with integrated data from all features
- **Credit System**: Credit consumption, refunds, and balance management
- **Demo Mode**: Full app experience for unauthenticated users

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure
- **Security**: App Check enforcement, CORS protection, rate limiting
- **Monitoring**: Sentry integration, structured logging, health checks
- **Testing**: Comprehensive E2E test suite covering all major flows
- **Deployment**: Automated CI/CD with Firebase Hosting and Functions
- **Observability**: `/ops` admin console, `/system/health` endpoint

### ‚úÖ Data Management
- **Firestore Schema**: Well-structured user data with proper security rules
- **File Storage**: Secure image/video uploads with signed URLs
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user and global rate limits on API endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses and fallback mechanisms

## Known Issues

### üö® Critical Issues
- **Temporary Uploads Cleanup**: Scan uploads in `uploads/{uid}/{scanId}/` are not automatically cleaned up after processing
- **App Check Enforcement**: Firestore, Storage, and Functions App Check enforcement not enabled in Firebase Console
- **Type Safety**: Some `any` types remain in codebase (tracked in TRACKING_ISSUES.md)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority
- **Unit Preferences**: User unit preferences not persisted (hardcoded to US units)
- **Subscription Filtering**: Plans page needs subscriber status awareness
- **Secret Management**: Inline defaults in env helpers need removal after production verification

### üìù Minor Issues
- **PWA Service Worker**: Disabled, needs safe versioning strategy for re-introduction
- **Health/Coach Shims**: Some placeholder services need real implementations
